# SilverStripe Platform Core Dependencies

This package contains dependencies and yml configuration to ensure the smooth operation of your site on SilverStripe Platform.

It is currently experimental, but may be recommended for all sites on SilverStripe Platform in the future.

## Installation

For SilverStripe 3 sites, use 1.x:

```
composer require silverstripe/ssp-core:^1@dev
```

For SilverStripe 4 sites, use 2.x:

```
composer require silverstripe/ssp-core:^2@dev
```

Until we release the first stable tag of this module, the `@dev` suffix is needed.
